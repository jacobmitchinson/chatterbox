# Makers Academy Pre-course Ruby Challenge

### Introduction 

The challenge was to enhance the capabilities of a chatbot. The spec was to: 

1. Add at least five more responses so that the bot has a bigger range of conversation
2. Add at least another two more responses that use regex capture groups - that's the %{c1} being replaced with whatever matched the brackets (.*) in the regular expression. In Ruby regex capture groups are stored in $1, $2 etc after a regex match takes place
3. Extend the bot so that there is a key word, e.g. "quit" that will end the session
4. Add a prompt in front of each sentence to indicate if either the person or the bot is talking
5. Make the bot and the person's chat different colours
6. Extend the bot so that it can handle more than two regular expression capture groups
7. Extend the bot to that the user can add new kinds of responses through the chat interaction
8. Extend the bot so that the set of responses is saved to a file and reloaded when the bot restarts

### Status

Project is complete. Maybe it would be nice to add a natural language component and/or some AI ;)

### What I learnt 

Enhanced regular expression knowledge and also working with across multiple methods.
